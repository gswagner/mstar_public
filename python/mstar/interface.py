"""This module defines interfaces for the low-level graphs and
policies used in Mstar. In general terms, these classes represent:

    1.  Graphs representing the configuration space.  These graphs are
        structured so that each node in the graph represents a
        configuration, and each edge represents a permissible transition
        between two different configurations.

        *All of these graphs subclass the Graph_Interface class

    2.  Policies, which define paths in a configuration space from an
        initial configuration to a goal configuration.  Policies are
        comprised of nodes, each of which represents a configuration
        in the configuration space.  Each node in a policy has a pointer
        to its optimal neighbor, i.e., the next node in the optimal path
        to the goal node.  Policy classes compute optimal paths by using
        some search algorithm to search the graphs generated in the
        classes described above.

        *All of these graphs subclass the Policy_Interface class

    3.  Configuration graph edge checking, which determines whether
        moving between two configurations is permissible.  For example,
        configuration graph edge checking should not allow a robot to
        move out of bounds of the workspace.

    4.  Planner edge checking, which determines whether moving between
        two states of robot positions will result in any collisions.
        For example, planner edge checking should check to see if two
        robots pass through each other as they move between positions.
