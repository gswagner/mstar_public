This module defines all of the classes for the low-level graphs and
policies used in Mstar. In general terms, these classes represent:

    1.  Graphs representing the configuration space.  These graphs are
        structured so that each node in the graph represents a
        configuration, and each edge represents a permissible transition
        between two different configurations.

        *All of these graphs subclass the Graph_Interface class

    2.  Policies, which define paths in a configuration space from an
        initial configuration to a goal configuration.  Policies are
        comprised of nodes, each of which represents a configuration
        in the configuration space.  Each node in a policy has a pointer
        to its optimal neighbor, i.e., the next node in the optimal path
        to the goal node.  Policy classes compute optimal paths by using
        some search algorithm to search the graphs generated in the
        classes described above.

        *All of these graphs subclass the Policy_Interface class

There are specific implementations of policies and classes within this
module.  These are:

    1.  Grid_Graph and Grid_Graph_Conn_8: These subclass Graph_Interface
        and are used to represent simple configuration spaces in a
        2-dimensional grid.  Each point on the grid is delegated with
        either a zero or a one, to represent a free space or an
        object in that location, respectively.  Grid_Graph specifies
        a configuration space with 4 connectivity; i.e., each robot
        can only go to the space immediately above its current position,
        below its current position, or to the left or right of its
        current position.  Grid_Graph_Conn_8 specifies a configuration
        space with all the moves described in Grid_Graph, but with
        additional options options of moving diagonally.

    2.  Flood_Fill_Policy:  This subclasses Policy_Interface and
        generates an optimal path to a goal configuration by using a
        flood fill.  This method of policy generation relies on a series
        of pointers between nodes to generate a policy.  It starts
        with the goal node on an open list.  At each step, the
        algorithm pops a node off of the open list and calculates its
        neighbors, appending them to the open list.  It iterates through
        the generated neighbors and checks to see if they should point
        to the popped node, based on the popped node's cost and their
        own cost.  If they should, their pointer is changed and cost is
        updated.  Eventually, the algorithm finds the starting node, and
        an optimal policy has been generated.

        2.1 To reduce the amount of code that has to be copied each
            time a new workspace is generated, actions that deal with
            the workspace itself (rather than the configuration graph)
            are passed into Flood_Fill_Policy as functions

    3.  Astar_Policy:  This subclasses Policy_Interface and
        generates  an optimal policy to a goal configuration by using
        the A* search algorithm.  A* uses a Best-First Search approach
        to generate optimal paths in lower-order average time than flood
        fill.

        3.1 To reduce code that needs to copied for each new workspace,
            a scheme similar to that described in 2.1 has also
            been implemented in Astar.

    4.  Priority_Graph:  This subclasses Policy_Interface and
        generates an optimal policy to a goal configuration using
        an Astar_Policy graph.  However, Priority_Graph also adds
        a time slot to each coordinate.  This way, routes can be planned
        for time in addition to space.

    5.  Back_Priority_Graph:  This subclasses Priority_Graph and
        generates an optimal policy to a goal configuration. Differs
        from Priority Graph in that time dynamics are configured for
        planning backwards in time.

Finally, an Edge_Checker class is implemented in the bottom of this
module.  This class checks for collisions occurring when two robots
attempt to move past each other.

Module urrently assumes that all actions have equal cost (including
diagonal vs non-diagonal move
